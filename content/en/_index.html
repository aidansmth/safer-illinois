<p>Illinois Street is a vital commute route for people on bikes, scooters, and other micro-mobility devices and provides
    access to some of the east sideâ€™s most important parks and recreational facilities. According to the U.S. Census, 31% of
    households surrounding Illinois Street do not own a car. By making Illinois safer for people outside of vehicles, more
    of our neighbors will walk, bike, and scoot to work and play, making the neighborhood healthier and safer for all.
</p>

<p>
    Illinois Street is also heavily used by cement trucks, big rigs, and other commercial and private vehicles. Neighbors
    from Potrero Hill, Dogpatch, and Bayview-Hunters Point have come together to make a plan for a high-quality, protected,
    and separated bikeway that will allow Illinois Street to be safely shared by all these users.
