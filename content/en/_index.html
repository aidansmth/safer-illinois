<p>Illinois Street is an important commuter route for bikes and scooters and provides access to some of the east sideâ€™s
most important parks and recreational facilities. It also gets heavy use by cement trucks, big rigs, and other
commercial and private vehicles. Neighbors from Potrero Hill, Dogpatch, and Bayview-Hunters Point have come together to
make a plan for high-quality, protected and separated bikeway that will allow Illinois Street to be safely shared
between all these users.

goals, and create a more vibrant, active city.</p>
