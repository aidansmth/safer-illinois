<p>Illinois Street has been long been identified in the as a critical multimodal connector that currently lacks the
    quality
    to make a significant different in our city's long failing Vision Zero and climate plans.</p>

<p>Please take some time to read our plan to create a Safer Illinois St. that would prevent deaths, help us reach our
    climate goals, and
    create a more vibrant, active city.</p>
