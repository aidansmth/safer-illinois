#### A Safer, Connected Illinois St. for All.

Illinois Street has been long been identified in the as a critical multimodal connector that currently lacks the quality to make a significant different in our city's long failing Vision Zero and climate plans. 

Current bike lanes are not protected, in the door zone for all parked vehicles, and are overrun with double-parked trucks. Vehicles,including many commercial trucks, regularly exceed safe speeds due to wide lanes, no posted speed limits, and missing stop signs/lights. **A safer Illinois St. would prevent deaths, help us reach our climate goals, and create a more vibrant, active city.**
