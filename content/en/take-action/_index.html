I am writing to ask you to make Illinois Street safe for bikes. Protected bike lanes on Illinois St. should be a priority in the coming months for inclusion in the 80 miles of quick builds pledged by Mayor Breed.

A protected bike route on Illinois would connect Cargo Way to Terry Francois, forming a 3+ mile protected bikeway along the Bay. This route would allow Hunter’s Point and Bayview residents to get to downtown safely, give families safe access to some of the best parks on the east side of the city, and connect to important east-west bike routes to get people safely to work, school, and businesses.

Illinois Street would be a centerpiece of the Active Communities Plan supporting the shift to active transportation needed to achieve our Vision Zero and Climate Action Plan goals.

I am writing to urge SFMTA staff and board to complete this project quickly.

Thank you.
